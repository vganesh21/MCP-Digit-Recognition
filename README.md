# MCP-Digit-Recognition
Uses Single Layer Multi Class Perceptron to identify single digits

Multi-Class Perceptron(MCP) with 10 classes for digits from 0 to 9

Uses only an input and output layer to calculate the weights of each path in the network and return a prediction

No backpropogation to correct weights, simply readjusts the weight vectors as it forward propogates

mcp.py contains the implementation of the Multi-Class Perceptron

howtouseMCP.py contains steps to show how the MCP is used and runs the Network on the included test and train data
